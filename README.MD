<h2>🦾 The working process:</h2>
 We did a Point Of Departure to get to know each other and set and align expectations in the team. 
 We brainstormed on a Miro board about all our different ideas for a game then we narrowed the ideas down step by step 
 until we had a winning idea. 
 Still on Miro we then set out to ideate about the different functionalities, rules and possibilities. 
 We then discussed and formulated together a game description and from there we created a pseudo code which gave us the different tickets in Trello.
 We decided what would be the MVP (minimal viable product) and what would be extra features.
 We had daily checkins to update each other on the process and worked a lot with Trello tickets to not work on the same features. 
 We regularly updated to GitHub and fetched so we could work with the latest features.

<h2>The projects content</h2>
We created a game underwater where a fish eats all the hidden plastics to save his friends. 
There are sound effects if bumping into other creatures in the sea.
The player has to be cautious of the sharks and the time ticking away. 
The scores from the best 3 players are fetched from Firestore and shown under the current players score. 
The player gets an encouraging text at the end with a hint to ro rise to the challenge to get a better score.
